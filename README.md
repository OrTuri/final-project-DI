This is an exercise tracking app that let's you keep track of your activities by tracking the activities location, duration and calorie burn. <br/>
You can also send instant messages to other users of the app and edit your activities after you have submitted them. <br/>

To create this app I have used React with Redux Toolkit to build the front end of the app. <br/>
I have also used the Leaflet map library to create the map. <br/>
In the backend I have used Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL for the Database. <br/>
To authenticate the users I used Json Web Token and all the passwords that are stored in the Database are encrypted using the Bcrypt module.
